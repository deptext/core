# Timing Utilities
#
# This module provides timing-related utilities for the DepText pipeline.
# It contains helper functions that work with the timing.json data generated
# by the mkProcessor factory.
#
# WHAT THIS MODULE DOES:
# - Provides functions to read and parse timing.json files
# - Contains constants and helpers for timing calculations
#
# NOTE: The actual timing capture happens in lib/processors/default.nix via
# the mkProcessor factory. This module provides utilities to work with that
# timing data after it's been captured.

{
  # Placeholder for timing utilities
  # Currently, timing capture is handled directly by mkProcessor in default.nix
  # This file exists for future expansion if needed
}
